# **Immersive Learning: Enhancing Historical Understanding Through VR and 2D Animation**

## **Description**
This project explores the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and 2D Animation as tools for enhancing user engagement and learning outcomes in historical education. The VR app focuses on the Newport Medieval Ship, allowing users to interact with historical tasks and gain a deeper understanding of the ship's historical significance and life on board. A comparative study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of VR versus traditional 2D video in conveying complex historical content.

## **Installation**
To get started with this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    - Open the project in **Unity Hub**.
    - Ensure **Blender 2.8+** is installed for 3D modelling.
4. (Optional) Install external assets such as **Oculus Integration** or **XR Interaction Toolkit** if needed.

## **Features**
- **Wood-Cutting Simulation**: Users can simulate a wood-cutting task using virtual tools.
- **Pour & Swirl Task**: Interactive experience simulating the process of pouring wine.
- **Nine Men’s Morris Game**: A historical game re-created in VR.
- **2D Animation**: Traditional animation of the Newport Medieval Ship for comparative study.

## **Usage**
- **VR App**: Requires **Meta Quest 3**. Users can interact with the ship and perform historically authentic tasks, including wood-cutting, wine pouring, and exploring the ship.
- **2D Animation**: Watch the animation on any media player to understand the ship’s historical narrative in a linear format.
